## Description
Embed a PDF from the Media Library or elsewhere via oEmbed or as a block into an `object` tag or Google Doc Viewer as fallback. The URL only has to be world reachable link.

Inspired by [Embed PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dirtysuds-embed-pdf/) and [RV Embed PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rv-embed-pdf/).

Many thanks to [Alex Kirk](https://github.com/akirk) for making Embed PDF Viewer compatible with the new block editor.

Pull requests are welcome against the `develop` branch.
